      "title": "\"Boiling Nemo\" by PJ Evans",
      "description": "In the course of recent history fish have been relatively untroubled by the Internet of Things, but it’s time for that to change. Armed only with a soldering iron, some JavaScript and ideas above his station, PJ will show us how you can build a simple IoT device and how the whole enterprise can spiral out of control. Highlights include a Scottish toilet emergency, an aquarium featuring military-grade security and an extinction-level event in the suburbs of Milton Keynes."
