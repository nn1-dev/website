      "description": "CSS is a beautiful nightmare of cascading chaos. To be truly bad at it requires mastery of arcane syntax. Together we’ll dive into the depths of the cascade to explore the \"wrong\" ways to write CSS - the hacks, the horrors, and the head-scratchers - and uncover the logic (or lack thereof) behind the language’s most unhinged features. You’ll leave this talk worse at CSS… and somehow better for it."
