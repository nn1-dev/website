## Who are you and what do you do?

I‚Äôm Emmanuella Okorie üëã

![Emmanuella Okorie](emmanuella.jpg)

- I love trying out new things and I‚Äôm not scared of a challenge.
- Table tennis is part of my weekly routine.
- Music? Can‚Äôt go a single day without it.
- I enjoy conversations that spark fresh ideas, and if they‚Äôre fun too, even better.

I'm a software engineer who‚Äôs spent the last three years in the data visualization space, building complex frontends and finding creative ways to make data feel simple and user-friendly. Right now, I‚Äôm wrapping up my Master‚Äôs in Software Engineering. For my dissertation, I‚Äôve been working on an indoor navigation system, which has been both challenging and super exciting. On the side, I like to write about technical concepts I find interesting. it‚Äôs my way of sharing what I‚Äôve learned and keeping ideas flowing.

## What first got you into tech?

At 17, in my third year of university, we were introduced to C++, and I immediately took a strong interest in it. It was the most challenging thing I‚Äôd come across that wasn‚Äôt entirely math, and that made it new and exciting for me.

I didn‚Äôt even have a laptop then, so I wrote code on my phone using SoloLearn. I wanted to do something with this new power, so I started learning about microcontrollers and how to control them with C++ using Arduino. I built a bunch of cool stuff, including an automatic trash can using a portable bin my dad had brought home as a souvenir.

That was the point I knew I wanted to make a career in programming, even though I was studying Electrical Engineering. The decision got even stronger when I discovered on LinkedIn how much software engineers could earn. The idea that I could do something I loved and make a good living out of it? My teenage self was completely sold.

## What does your typical working day look like?

I‚Äôve been working remotely with a great team for the past three years, and I honestly enjoy every moment of it.‚Ä®Since we‚Äôre a relatively small team, the work is always engaging and very hands-on. Most of my time goes into building the frontend architecture of one of our core products , The Dataxplorer app. It is a highly interactive environment that lets users create their own data visualizations and tell stories with them. I also chip in with middleware and backend work when needed.

Because I usually sleep past midnight, I don‚Äôt wake up before 8 a.m., which still gives me enough time to get ready for our daily standup.‚Ä®Outside of work, I carve out time to write new articles and push forward with my dissertation. In the evenings, I often go play table tennis, it‚Äôs my way of staying active, and trust me, it can get pretty intense.

Now that my lectures are over, my days feel a lot freer, so I try to maximize and enjoy them as much as I can. And one last thing, I can hardly function without a nap, so I always make space for an hour of rest in my day.

## What‚Äôs your setup? Software and hardware. Pictures welcomed!

My computer is a 13‚Äù M2 Macbook pro. I also use a 32‚Äù Samsung monitor.

## What‚Äôs the last piece of work you feel proud of?

Honestly, I‚Äôd say [Dataxplorer.org](https://dataxplorer.org). It‚Äôs the product I‚Äôve spent most of my time on over the last couple of years as one of its core developers. Working on it has taught me so much - everything from handling complex frontend states to writing scalable tests and covering tricky edge cases.

I‚Äôm really proud of how far it‚Äôs come, even though it‚Äôs still early days. New releases are rolling out frequently, and it‚Äôs exciting to see it grow. You should definitely check it out!

## What‚Äôs one thing about your profession you wish more people knew?

One thing I wish more people knew is how much being a programmer shapes you personally, beyond just shipping products. There‚Äôs something profound about solving a problem that at first feels impossible. And we get to do that every single day!

Over the years, this has taught me to stop doubting myself and to trust my ability to figure things out, no matter how tough they seem. That, to me, is the real gift of being a programmer.

## Share with others something worth checking out. Not necessarily tech related. Shameless plugs welcomed.

Definitely MCP (Model Context Protocol). I spend a lot of my free time following how MCP is growing and being adopted, and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs going to completely change the way we build and interact with software.

I‚Äôm actually giving a talk on MCP and its possibilities very soon, so stay tuned!
